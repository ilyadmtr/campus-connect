Repository: campus-connect

Description:
This Git repository hosts the source code and project files for "Campus Connect," a social media platform developed as part of my diploma work for "Professional College of Engineering, Management and Land Management of the National Aviation University". 

Campus Connect aims to connect students, faculty, and staff within the college community, providing a platform for communication, collaboration, and sharing of information. The project leverages modern web technologies and follows a client-server architecture, with a responsive front-end user interface and a scalable back-end server.

Features:
- User registration and authentication system
- Profile creation and customization
- Newsfeed for real-time updates and posts
- Groups and communities for specific interests
- Notifications and alerts

The repository contains the following structure:
- "client" directory: Holds the front-end code, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular.
- "server" directory: Contains the back-end code, implemented using a programming language like Python, Node.js, or Ruby on Rails.
- "database" directory: Includes the database schema and necessary scripts for data management.
- "documentation"
